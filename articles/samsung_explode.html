      <p>In 2016, Samsung faced a major crisis when its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones began catching fire and exploding due to battery defects. The issue triggered a global recall and raised serious questions about battery safety in smartphones.</p>

      <blockquote>
        “Samsung launched the Galaxy Note 7 to record preorders and sales in August, but the rosy start soon turned sour. Samsung had to initiate a recall in September of the first version of the Note 7 due to faulty batteries that overheated and exploded.”<br>
        — <cite><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maribellopez/2017/01/22/samsung-reveals-cause-of-note-7-issue-turns-crisis-into-opportunity/" target="_blank">FORBES</a></cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The initial problem was traced to batteries from Samsung SDI. A design flaw caused the electrodes to bend, which led to short circuits. Samsung switched to batteries from Amperex Technology Ltd., but those had their own manufacturing defects—like welding issues and missing insulation tape—that made them unstable as well.</p>

      <p>One device even caught fire aboard a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/business/southwest-samsung.html#:~:text=Southwest%20said%20in%20a%20statement,a%20replacement%20Galaxy%20Note%207.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">Southwest Airlines flight</a>, prompting an evacuation. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission formally recalled the Note 7, and Samsung discontinued it entirely.</p>

      <p>The financial damage was massive, with Samsung estimating losses of at least <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-battery-fires-heres-why-they-exploded" target="_blank">$5 billion</a>. The bigger hit, though, was to its brand reputation—shaking customer trust across the globe.</p>

      <blockquote>
        “Samsung’s reputation as an innovative tech company has suffered since the first announcements of the faulty batteries.”<br>
        — <cite><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/galaxy-note-7-issues-what-happened/" target="_blank">WIRED</a></cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Samsung responded by launching an 8-point battery safety check process that included X-rays, charge/discharge tests, and other inspections. These protocols have since become an industry benchmark.</p>

      <p>The Galaxy Note 7 incident remains a key example of how critical testing, transparency, and fast action are in the high-stakes tech world.</p>
