      <p>From contract reviews to courtroom appearances, artificial intelligence is making its case in the legal world. The rise of <strong>robo-lawyers</strong> — AI-powered legal assistants and tools — has sparked both excitement and alarm among professionals and the public alike.</p>

      <p>One of the most well-known examples is DoNotPay, an app originally created to help users fight parking tickets. It's evolved into an AI service that generates legal documents, negotiates bills, and even advises on small claims cases. And it’s not the only one — law firms are experimenting with generative AI to draft arguments, assess risk, and speed up litigation processes.</p>

      <blockquote>
        “The legal system isn’t going away — but the way we interact with it is. AI will democratize access to justice in ways we’ve never seen before.”<br>
        — Joshua Browder, Founder of DoNotPay
      </blockquote>

      <p>Proponents argue that robo-lawyers will increase efficiency, reduce costs, and open up legal services to those who’ve been historically excluded. Why pay thousands for a lawyer when an AI can offer reliable guidance in seconds?</p>

      <p>But critics worry about bias, accountability, and the nuances of law that machines might not grasp. Who's responsible if a robo-lawyer gives bad advice? Can an algorithm truly understand intent, motive, or moral ambiguity?</p>

      <p>The future of AI in law isn’t black and white. As regulations evolve and the technology matures, we may soon see a hybrid system: part human, part machine — all under oath.</p>
