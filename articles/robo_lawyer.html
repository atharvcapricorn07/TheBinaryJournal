      <h1>Robo-Lawyers: Justice by Algorithm</h1>
      <p class="byline">By Atharv Kale • 5/15/2025</p>

        Imagine walking into a courtroom, not to be greeted by a suited attorney with years of law school behind them—but by an AI bot that can recite precedents faster than Google can autocomplete your search. Welcome to the future of law: Robo-lawyers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Companies like DoNotPay and Harvey are using large language models to help users contest parking tickets, draft legal documents, and even guide them through small claims court—all without a single hour of billable time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The appeal? Speed, efficiency, and massive cost reduction. While traditional legal representation can run thousands of dollars per case, AI tools can generate documents and legal advice in seconds for a fraction of the cost.

      <blockquote>
        “If lawyers are scared of AI, maybe it’s because their $400/hour models are no longer sustainable,” says Stanford law student Mira Shah.

        But critics warn that these robo-attorneys are limited. They can't replace human judgment, lack nuance, and struggle in emotionally charged or complex cases. There's also the issue of accountability—if an AI gives bad legal advice, who's to blame?
      </p>

      <p>
        Courts are still debating the extent to which AI should be involved. In 2023, a judge in California halted an AI-based legal argument mid-hearing, citing unauthorized legal representation. And in Europe, regulators are calling for stricter oversight of AI-driven legal tools.

      <p>
        Still, the trajectory is clear: AI isn’t just disrupting taxis and tweets—it’s marching into the courtroom. Whether it will balance the scales of justice or tip them entirely remains to be seen.
