      <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transitioned from a futuristic concept to a tangible force in the modern workplace. From automating repetitive tasks to driving strategic decisions, AI is reshaping what it means to work in virtually every industry.</p>
    
      <blockquote>
        “While AI may eliminate 75 million jobs by 2025, it is expected to create 133 million new ones — a net positive of 58 million jobs.”<br>
        — <a href="https://www.weforum.org/press/2018/09/machines-will-do-more-tasks-than-humans-by-2025-but-robot-revolution-will-still-create-58-million-net-new-jobs-in-next-five-years/" target="_blank">World Economic Forum</a>
      </blockquote>
    
      <p>Businesses across sectors are using AI to enhance productivity, reduce operational costs, and personalize customer experiences. Salesforce, for example, uses AI-driven tools like <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/career-connect-announcement/" target="_blank">Career Connect</a> and Career Agent to match employees with internal job opportunities, promoting mobility and skill growth.</p>
    
      <p>But rapid AI adoption hasn’t come without tension. According to <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/technology/article/nearly-a-third-of-uk-workers-secretly-use-ai-research-finds-m8dsm0pt0" target="_blank">The Times</a>, 29% of UK employees are secretly using generative AI at work — often without their employers’ knowledge — suggesting growing anxiety about job security and staying competitive.</p>
    
      <p>Still, many professionals see AI not as a threat, but as a powerful collaborator. A <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/651203/workplace-answering-big-questions.aspx" target="_blank">Gallup poll</a> found that 45% of workers said AI tools improved their productivity, especially in automating mundane or repetitive tasks.</p>
    
      <p>As AI continues to evolve, it’s clear that its impact will be nuanced. It won't just replace jobs — it will redefine them. The real challenge lies in how organizations and individuals adapt, reskill, and embrace this new wave of intelligent tools.</p>
