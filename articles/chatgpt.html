      <p>When ChatGPT hit the mainstream, students saw opportunity, teachers saw red flags—and education entered a new era of AI-assisted learning. But where’s the line between help and harm?</p>

      <p>From solving math problems to writing full essays, ChatGPT has become a digital Swiss Army knife for students. For some, it’s a lifeline during late-night study sessions. For others, it's a shortcut around actual learning.</p>

      <p>“My students started turning in perfect essays,” one high school English teacher told NPR. “I knew something was off.” And she was right—many were using AI to write their papers. But is that cheating, or just using modern tools?</p>

      <p>Proponents argue that ChatGPT can enhance education. It can explain complex concepts in plain language, act as a tutor, and even support neurodivergent learners by providing tailored feedback. Used responsibly, it's like having an assistant available 24/7.</p>

      <p>But the risks are real. Overreliance on AI can stunt critical thinking, and not all answers generated are accurate or unbiased. Plus, educators now face a new kind of plagiarism—one that's harder to detect and easy to deny.</p>

      <p>Some schools have banned the use of AI entirely. Others are leaning in, teaching students how to use it ethically and creatively. A few are even encouraging assignments that integrate ChatGPT, followed by reflection or critique.</p>

      <p>So is ChatGPT ruining school—or reinventing it? Maybe both. As with any tool, the key lies in how it's used. Education systems will need to evolve, not just to catch cheaters, but to empower learners in an AI-shaped world.</p>
